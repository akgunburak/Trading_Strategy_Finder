# Trading Strategy Finder
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  This is my bachelor's degree graduation project. In this work, I created a framework for both analyzing and finding a trading strategy. 
It can be used by first defining a class and picking a variety of methods optionally. Methods contain indicators, backtests, graphs, etc. The usage may found in 
Implementation.py file. Just in case, the same file is available [**here**](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/akgunburak/Trading_Strategy_Finder/blob/master/Implementation.ipynb)
